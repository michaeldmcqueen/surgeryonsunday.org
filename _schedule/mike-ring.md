title: 'Mike Ring  "I Was A Fire"'
description: "Between its driving rhythms, vocal panache, and melodies designed to hook deep, a careless listener might think Mike Ring's music is simply bombastic indie-pop. While the 24-year-old Colorado songwriter powers his songs with an infectious energy—both in his highly polished recordings and manic live show—his true artistic stamp is honesty and intimacy of his lyrics. Ring's lyrical voice is bold and unique, finding deep emotional resonance in sharp, elegant images and straightforward language. His ability to wrestle with themes of love, family, longing, and hope with clarity and immediacy drive the verve of his music."
