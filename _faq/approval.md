Once we have received your referral paperwork and you have been approved, we will send you an agreement to complete for our program. Upon receipt of that information, a pre-operative appointment will be scheduled for you.  If the surgeon determines your condition is surgical, you will be placed on the next available surgery date. Currently, the process takes 30-60 days and depends on the waitlist and surgeon availability.
