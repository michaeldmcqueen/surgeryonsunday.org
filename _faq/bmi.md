All surgeries are provided in an outpatient setting and we set a limit of a BMI of 35 to ensure safety during anesthesia.  On a limited basis, we will review patient requests for those slightly over 35 if they do not have sleep apnea or blood pressure issues.  The decision rests slowly with the anesthesia supervisor.
