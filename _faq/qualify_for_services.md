An individual must live within a 250 mile radius of Lexington, Kentucky.  This is in order to ensure a patient receives appropriate post-operative care.  Occasionally, the medical review Committee will consider requests outside of the 250 mile radius on a very limited basis.  The final decision rests with the review committee as well as the surgeon.
