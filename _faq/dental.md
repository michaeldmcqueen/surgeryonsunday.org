We provide limited oral surgery, which is usually partial or full extractions.  We have partnered with local dentists to provide semi-annual Free Dental Days, which are tentatively planned for October 2016 and April 2017.  However, we do not provide any regular dental services other than the partial or full extractions.  Please note we do not provide dentures following extractions.  The University of Kentucky Dental Clinic does provide dentures at a discounted cost.  They can be reached at 859.323.5992.
