In its first year the Mental Health Festival is a quest for self discovery and health and happiness in the Fort Collins community. The event is set to take place at venues across Fort Collins October 14-15 and aims to support arts and challenge ideas about what mental health looks and feels like. 

By connection with artists and bridging the community we celebrate art and achievements of people and offer support for the creatives in our community that struggle with mental health, exploring the relationship between creativity and the mind and promoting positive health and well being.
