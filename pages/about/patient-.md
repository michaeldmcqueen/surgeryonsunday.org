To everybody connected to Surgery on Sunday, I want to thank every person who helps. &nbsp;I had a colonoscopy in 2011 and I could not have been treated better. I thank God for you all and may God bless each and every one of you. &nbsp;Patient Sandra F.

Thank you to all the Surgery on Sunday volunteers for making this program possible. &nbsp;I am so grateful there are people like you who give their time and effort to make care available to someone like me. &nbsp;I had hernia repair surgery on February 20 and greatly appreciate everyone who is involved. I feel so fortunate to have been allowed to have my procedure done and greatly appreciate each and every one who participates in this desperately needed program! &nbsp;Patient Patricia A.

I want to thank you all that made my surgery happen. Everyone was so good and kind and I know it took time out of your life but it meant the world to me. &nbsp;So thank you all from the bottom of my heart. Patient Carol R.

My son was lucky enough to receive surgery through Surgery on Sunday. &nbsp;His conditions were diagnosed in 2005 and 2008 at two different sliding scale clinics. &nbsp;He was disabled and in pain. &nbsp;One doctor told him that if his hernia became strangulated, it would be life threatening, but there was nowhere to turn for help. &nbsp;That was until we were introduced to Surgery on Sunday. &nbsp;Everyone treated my son, and our family, like gold. We felt the kindness in your hearts and the caring in your eyes. &nbsp;You’ve shown us what the world can be like when there is love. You all have rekindled hope. We are not alone. We have been touched by the angels of SOS. &nbsp;Sharon G., patient’s mother

Thank you for providing the recent opportunity for me to receive a diagnostic endoscopy. &nbsp;As a survivor of colon cancer, I am fully aware of the importance of a periodic follow-up colonoscopy. &nbsp;But given my present fiscal situation and the cost of the procedure, I’d have to put it off indefinitely. &nbsp;Thank you all very much! &nbsp;Patient Josh O.

We would like to thank the Surgery on Sunday program and all the volunteers involved for accepting our son for gallbladder surgery. &nbsp;Everyone we came into contact with there was so amazingly nice to our family and our son was in greats hands from start to finish. &nbsp;Special thanks, of course, to Dr. Iocono for his excellent surgical skill and the ideas to get us into the program in the first place. &nbsp;We could not have asked for a better outcome. There really aren’t enough ways to thank everyone for the kindness and caring we experienced during our time of need for our son. &nbsp;Heather G, patient’s mother

Thank you for taking your time away from your family and friends to help me through a tough, painful time. It means everything to me and my family! &nbsp;Patient Kimberly S.
