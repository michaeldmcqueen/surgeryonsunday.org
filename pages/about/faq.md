Surgery on Sunday is thankful to have many supporters who provide financial support and in-kind donations.  These donations enable Surgery on Sunday to operate on a very tight budget, spending 88% of our expenses on direct patient care and allowing us to provide surgeries at an average cost of $300.

By providing an outpatient procedure at an average cost of $300, we are able to care for more patients in need.  Our main goal when caring for a patient is to rid them of disease and pain without a financial burden. If not for our program, many of these individuals would suffer for years or receive care at an Emergency Room with a massive hospital bill they are unable to pay.
