Surgery on Sunday is blessed to have many supporters, not only from across the state of Kentucky, but across the country. The generous monetary donations and in-kind donations enable us to provide surgeries at an average cost of $300 per procedure. The lower our cost per procedure, the more lives we are able to change and additional services we are able to add, such as semi-annual Free Dental Days.

Below are examples of how your donations will be used:

**$25** Gas card/taxi vouchers for patients who are unable to afford transportation to their appointments/surgery.

**$50** Provide 5 Children with stuffed animals to ease anxiety prior to surgery

**$100** Hotel stay for 2 patients who travel great distances for their early surgery Arrival time

**$300** Provides surgery for 1 patient

**$500** Provides imaging required for surgery for 3 patients

**$900** Pays for surgery for 3 patients

**$3,600** Provides one month of surgeries for 12 patients (average patient volume)
