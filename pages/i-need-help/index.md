Surgery on Sundayâ€™s mission is to change lives one surgery at a time.  Our program assists uninsured and underinsured, income eligible individuals who do not qualify for federal or state government assistance. Outpatient surgeries are provided the third Sunday of each month at no cost to individuals that qualify for Surgery on Sunday.

Our program serves individuals within a 250 mile radius of Lexington, Kentucky.  Occasionally, the Medical Review Committee will consider patients that are located outside of the traditional service area, however, this is on an extremely limited basis and is at the discretion of the surgeon.

Only medically essential outpatient procedures are provided as we aim to rid individuals of disease and pain. No surgery that is deemed cosmetic is offered, including, but not limited to: excess skin removal, weight loss surgery and cosmetic implants, among others. In addition, only procedures that can be performed in the outpatient setting are offered through Surgery on Sunday.  Anything that requires an inpatient stay, including a hysterectomy, are not provided by Surgery on Sunday.

To be considered for Surgery on Sunday, an individual MUST be referred by a medical professional.  NO SELF-REFERRALS ARE ACCEPTED. In addition, to receive care a patient must have a primary care health professional they see on a regular basis.  For many of our patients, this is a Free Clinic. Please see the list of free clinics if you need to establish a primary care home.  (LINK)

To qualify for the program, an individual must meet the following requirements:

1.  Total household income is up to 250% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines

2.  Individual is uninsured   OR
3.  Has a high-deductible plan that is 10% or more of household income
4.  Body Mass Index (BMI) is 35 or lower.  Click here to calculate your BMI. http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm

A referral by a medical provider is required, which is obtained by the below paperwork being completed.  The provider will need to complete the referral agency information, as well as the second page regarding medications and conditions that currently exist.  The rest of the information will need to be supplied by the patient; demographic information, health information authorization and income verification.

Once an individual has been approved for acceptance, Surgery on Sunday will send a patient contract and medication sheet that must be completed in order for a patient to receive care.  Upon receipt of the patient contract, Surgery on Sunday will schedule a pre-operative consultation with an appropriate surgeon. If it is determined that surgical intervention is required, the patient will be placed on the next available surgery date.

Since all of the medical providers with Surgery on Sunday are volunteers, surgery schedules are dependent on surgeon availability.  In addition, because all of our services are offered free of charge, the demand for our program is greater than we can address within one month, thus a waiting list exists for our services and surgery schedule.

Currently, from referral to surgery is taking approximately 60-90 days.
