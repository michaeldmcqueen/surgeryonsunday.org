Currently, Spanish speaking patients we serve accounts for 40% of our patient volume. &nbsp;As with any medical facility, we provide certified medical interpreters during the day of surgery for our Spanish speaking patients and their physicians. &nbsp;

To serve our patients, individuals must be a certified medical interpreter.
