At Surgery on Sunday, we encourage learning and shadowing for students 16 years old and above. &nbsp;As these opportunities are very popular and we limit the number per surgery day due to operating room space, there is an extensive waiting list. &nbsp;Currently the wait time is approximately 6 months.

To be added to the waiting list, please complete the form below.

Our Volunteer Coordinator will be in touch when a shadowing opportunity becomes available.
