To become a clinical volunteer for Surgery on Sunday, please complete the following application. &nbsp;The credentialing process will take up to 60 days as our Credentialing Committee meets once a month to approve applicants. Only those applicants approved will be submitted to our malpractice insurance. &nbsp;No one can volunteer with us until they have been approved by our malpractice provider, the Federal Government through the FTCA.

Following this approval, you will receive an email and be added to our communication lists and will begin receiving requests for volunteers.

Please note, incomplete applications will be returned and will not be considered until complete. &nbsp;This does include the request for references, which Surgery on Sunday will contact.

Currently our most needed clinical volunteers are: PACU nurses, scrub techs, CRNAs and anesthesiologists.
