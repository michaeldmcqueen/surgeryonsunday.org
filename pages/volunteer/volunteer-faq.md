Surgery on Sunday is only able to help those in need through the generosity of our volunteers.  Other than a full-time Executive Director, everyone at Surgery on Sunday is a volunteer, including surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, scrub techs and administrative personnel, among others.  Since inception, our 400+ volunteers have donated nearly 95,000 hours of service.

For one surgery day to occur, 40-60 volunteers are required, depending on patient volume. Besides surgery days, volunteers are needed for office work, special projects and special events.

While most of volunteer needs are for clinicians, who do have work for non-clinical individuals.  However, please not these positions are limited on surgery days. 

At Surgery on Sunday, we encourage learning and shadowing for students 16 years old and above.  As these opportunities are very popular and we limit the number per surgery day due to operating room space, there is an extensive waiting list.
