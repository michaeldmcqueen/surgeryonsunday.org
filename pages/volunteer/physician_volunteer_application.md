Thank you for your interest in serving our patients. To participate in our program, you must complete the following application. The credentialing process will take up to 60 days as our Credentialing Committee meets once a month to approve applicants. Only those applicants approved will be submitted to our malpractice insurance. &nbsp;No one can volunteer with us until they have been approved by our malpractice provider, the Federal Government through the FTCA.

By becoming a physician volunteer, you agree to see patients for a pre-operative consultation, perform surgery and provide post-operative consultation at no charge to the patient. If the patient needs an interpreter, additional diagnostic testing or imaging, these services will be provided by Surgery on Sunday.

Following this approval, you will receive a communication asking for you to indicate your availability. &nbsp;Please note the need for your services is completely dictated by our patient volume and the type of care they are seeking. &nbsp;General surgery are the cases that are most common and occur each surgery day. &nbsp;Other specialties are typically not needed every month and there might be a lull in between your volunteer service.
