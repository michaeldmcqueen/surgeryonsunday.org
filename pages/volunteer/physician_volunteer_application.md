**What are the volunteer minimum age requirements?**

Per Board policy and policy of the Lexington Surgery Center, volunteers must be 16 years of age, with parental consent, to assist during surgery days. &nbsp;On a very limited basis, they could assist in the office on surgery days. &nbsp;Students under 16 can assist at special events as long as no alcoholic beverages are being served.

**How do I become a volunteer?**

Please read through the Frequently Asked Questions and complete the appropriate volunteer application (physician, clinical, general). &nbsp;Any clinical applicant will have to be credentialed as they would be at any other health care facility. This process takes up to 60 days and the applicant will have to be approved by our credentialing committee.

**I have no clinical background, can I still volunteer?**

Yes. &nbsp;Surgery on Sunday has many needs in addition to clinical needs, such as office/clerical work and volunteering at special events. &nbsp;There are limited non-clinical duties on surgery days, but please note they are very limited.

**How long does the volunteer approval process take?**

For clinical volunteers, the process will take up to 60 days. &nbsp;During this time, you will be credentialed as you would be at any other health care facility. &nbsp;Your application must be approved by our Credentialing Committee before you are added to our malpractice insurance. &nbsp;The process for non-clinical volunteers is much shorter, approximately 30 days.

**I am a pre-op nurse but want to gain experience in the OR. Can I volunteer as an OR nurse?**

No. &nbsp;Clinical volunteers are only able to volunteer in areas they currently work. &nbsp;In short, if you would not be permitted to work in an area during your normal work with your employer, you would not be allowed to do so at Surgery on Sunday.

**Do you provide malpractice insurance?**

Yes. Every volunteer, clinical and non-clinical, is covered by our malpractice insurance, which is provided by the federal government through the Federal Torts Claim Act (FTCA). &nbsp;http://www.bphc.hrsa.gov/ftca/about/index.html &nbsp;Absolutely no one is allowed to volunteer until they have been added to the FTCA and been approved.

**I am interested in a medical career or I am currently a medical/nursing student and would like to shadow, are there opportunities?**

Yes. &nbsp;However, the number of shadowing positions are limited each surgery day to keep the number of people in the OR at a manageable number. &nbsp;In addition, these opportunities are extremely popular and a waiting list exists. &nbsp;To be added to the list, complete this form (link to send to database). &nbsp;Our Volunteer Coordinator will contact you when it is your turn to shadow. Please note the wait time could be 6-9 months.

**What are the most needed volunteers?**

Currently, Surgery on Sunday is in need of PACU nurses, scrub techs, CRNAs and anesthesiologists.

**Do you have volunteer opportunities for groups?**

Due to the nature of our program, group opportunities are not available on surgery days, short of providing breakfast and/or lunch. &nbsp;However, a group would easily be able to volunteer at one of our special events.

**I do not have a license to practice in the state of Kentucky, can I still volunteer.**

No. All licensed clinical volunteers MUST have a valid Kentucky license to volunteer for Surgery on Sunday.
