Tony Reyes was named Interpreter Coordinator in September of 2015.  Tony has been the lead medical interpreter for Surgery on Sunday since inception in 2005.  In addition to surgery days, he assists with pre-operative calls and appointment confirmations with surgeons.  Tony is responsible for ensuring qualified medical interpreters are on the bedside with patients during surgery days to ensure terminology and understanding is communicated properly to the medical providers and patients.

Having completed his medical interpreting training through Bridging the Gap in May of 2005, Tony has worked with the migrant community through the Bluegrass Farmworker’s Health Center, medical interpreter at the University of Kentucky’s Family Care Center and for the last year has been interpreting for medical professionals triaging phone calls for the entire UK Department of Pediatrics.  Tony resides in Lexington with his wife, Norma and his daughter Yleana (and hopefully soon adoptive daughter from Mexico, Reyna).
