- question: Where must I reside in order to qualify for services?
  answer: 'An individual must live within a 250 mile radius of Lexington, Kentucky.  This is in order to ensure a patient receives appropriate post-operative care.  Occasionally, the medical review Committee will consider requests outside of the 250 mile radius on a very limited basis.  The final decision rests with the review committee as well as the surgeon.'
- question: My Body Mass Index (BMI) is over 35.  Why do I not qualify for the program?
  answer: 'All surgeries are provided in an outpatient setting and we set a limit of a BMI of 35 to ensure safety during anesthesia.  On a limited basis, we will review patient requests for those slightly over 35 if they do not have sleep apnea or blood pressure issues.  The decision rests slowly with the anesthesia supervisor.'
